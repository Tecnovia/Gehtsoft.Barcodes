		Gehtsoft.Barcodes is a cross-platform C# library for generation of different types of barcodes and QR codes. The goal of the Gehtsoft.Barcodes library is to provide .NET application developers with a solution that allows them to create barcodes (including QR codes) quickly. 
		You can easily add barcodes to your application using the convenient API methods.

		The following platforms are supported:
		- .NET Framework 4.5.1 and later
	 	- .NET Standard 2.0
	
		MAIN FEATURES
		Currently the library supports generation of the following types of barcodes and QR codes: 
			- EAN8;
			- EAN13;
			- GS1-128A;
			- GS1-128B;
			- GS1-128C;
			- UPC_A;
			- QR codes

		Using the GS PDFFlow library (https://www.nuget.org/packages/Gehtsoft.PDFFlowlib), you can easily add barcodes to simple and complex documents that you 
		generate in C#.
